# the-bachelor

data from https://www.kaggle.com/brianbgonz/the-bachelor-contestants

- on average you survive longer on the show if you're younger
- small sample size though
- also utility doesn't increase linearly week-to-week
- we can't account for non-basic strategies (remove weakest contestant each week) by the bachelor

that's probably enough
